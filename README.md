# Omited Variable Bias Shiny App

This app was developed primarily to visualise omitted variable bias for my students. At the time of writing, it can be found live at [https://philswatton.shinyapps.io/omitted_variable/](https://philswatton.shinyapps.io/omitted_variable/).

The app.R file contains the app itself, while the app_deploy.R script deploys/updates the app on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
